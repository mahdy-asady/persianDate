# persianDate
simple unix timestamp to jalali converter

I want to introduce jalali timestamp in addition to unix timestamp.
It can simply calculated based on unix timestamp. just add 42531868800 to unix timestamp and you have jalali timestamp.
to be simple. you can just include persianDate.php, send your desire timestamp to getPersianDate() function and you have jalali date and time in return.
